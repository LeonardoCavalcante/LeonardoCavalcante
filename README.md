# 👋 Hello! I'm Leonardo Cavalcante

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate developer who loves learning, solving problems, and building meaningful solutions through code. My enthusiasm for programming comes from the excitement of turning ideas into functional, scalable products — and staying updated with the latest tech trends is part of my daily routine.

I enjoy working on backend development, designing APIs, and writing clean, maintainable code. I'm always looking to learn, improve, and collaborate on projects that have real impact.
